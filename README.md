## DATE:07/10/2025

## AIM: 
To create orthographic view of given 3D model

## REQUIREMENTS: 
1. Autodesk fusion 360
2. Windows 10
3. 16 GB of RAM (integrated graphics recommend 1 GB or more)
4. 2.5 Mbps or faster download; 500 Kbps or faster upload 

## PROCEDURE:

### STEP-1:
Open Fusion 360 and select file and click new file
